# 3RWW Rainfall API

> A clean API for 3RWW's immense trove of historical rainfall data for Allegheny County.

This API taps the existing legacy 3RWW rainfall website for data, and returns it back in a structure `json` format. It is designed to enable straightforward, programmatic access to 3RWW's amazing trove of historical rainfall data for Allegheny County,and in turn will support the planned development of new graphic user interface(s) for that data.

This application is in beta, and it's likely that the structure of the requests, endpoints, and other things will change.
