    allowEmptyValue: true
    description: ALCOSAN Sewershed Planning Basin for which to get rainfall data. This is effectively a shortcut for the pixels parameter, letting you specify general areas of interest for which to retrieve rainfall data. By default, this parameter will retreive data for all basins (but not all available pixels, which cover the entire county). If pixels are specified in the pixel IDs parameter, this parameter will be ignored. If no basin is specified, and no pixels are specified, all pixels for the county will be retrieved.

    items:
      type: integer
    allowEmptyValue: true
    description: List of pixels to return, using the six-digit pixel ID number ("123-456"). Defaults to None. This parameter will override the basin parameter. If no basin is specified in the basin parameter, and this parameter is left empty, all pixels will be returned. IDs are provided in the geojson file returned by the 'garrd-grid' endpoint.
  - name: keyed_by

    type: string
    default: "time"
    enum: ["time", "location"]
    allowEmptyValue: true
    description: Value type on which the returned data is indexed. "Time" means data will be indexed by time, then by location (the pixel ID); "Location" is vice versa. Defaults to time.
